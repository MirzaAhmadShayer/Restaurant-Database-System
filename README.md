# Restaurant-Database-System

This is a Restaurant Database System made in Java Swing. The database was made in PHPMyAdmin. This system is made using the MVC pattern

Firstly, people login to the system with username and password. Then they are greeted by the main application.
The system can show menus of various foods. There is appetizers, bevrages, desserts, extras, main courses, specials. People can also get discounts, know 
their accounts information. One can also get contact info of the restaurant. Can also give home delivery.

If one wishes to change any order one can select the item and remove it. If one wishes to remove all items one can simply reset the full table. The order now
button checks the order out and shows the amount charged. If discounts are active the discounts are take to consideration and then calculated. The exit button 
exits the system.
